# Expanding the synthetic biology toolbox with a library of constitutive and repressible promoters

The goal is to identify constitutive promoters from the Arabdiopsis genome and validating them in *Arabidopsis* and in *Nicotiana benthamiana* (Tobacco).

The promoters were also modified to be repressible to build logic NOR gates in Tobacco.

The folders contains all the codes used in the manuscript
